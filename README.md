# FastMaps

An eventual Google Maps add-on that will provide the best route to visit all given locations in while travelling between a given start and end point. Similar to the Travelling Salesman Problem, with a few key differences that make it not quite the same.

IMPORTANT: This project is LARGELY unfinished. It will continue to be updated as work is done, but as of now, this repository is storing many unfinished ideas.
